Hello Copilot,

I need to create a set of API endpoints for the SuperAdmin role in my NestJS application. The SuperAdmin should have full control over managing shops and users. Please follow the detailed specifications below to implement the features.

**General Requirements:**
*   All endpoints listed below must be protected and accessible only by users with the `SUPERADMIN` role.
*   Use the existing `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard` for this purpose: `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` and `@Roles(UserRole.SUPERADMIN)`.
*   Assume `UserRole` is available from `src/users/schemas/user.schema`.
